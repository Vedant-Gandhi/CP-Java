# CP-Java
### This repo holds all the problems of CP from various sources.The questions are inside the files as url or direct questions mentioned.

### Points to remember :
1. Go to src directory to view the problems.
2. You are free to clone or copy the repository.
3. The solutions here are in Java itself.If you want you can open new PR for other languages too with different problems too.The main goal is to get a lot of problems and solutions in different languages in one repo.
4. If possible put some test cases too so that learners can evaluate on right path. ( This is not necessary if the question is a URL to some kind of coding platform where there are test cases. )
